Instajam
========

Instajam is a JavaScript wrapper for the Instagram API. You provide the access token, Instajam makes the toast.

## Getting Started

To use Instajam, just include it in your page. For now, Instajam also requires jQuery to facilitate JSONP requests.

```
<script src="lib/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="lib/instajam.js"></script>
```

### Authentication

Instajam doesn't care how you do OAuth authentication. Want to handle it server-side and just pass the access token in? Cool. Would you rather do client-side authentication and pull your access token from a cookie or localStorage? Legit, brah. Regardless of how you do it, initialize Instajam like this:

```
<script type="text/javascript">
  $(function() {

    var INSTAJAM = new Instajam({
      access_token: 'ACCESS TOKEN',
      client_id: 'CLIENT ID'
    });

  });
</script>
```

Keep in mind, ```client_id``` is optional if you pass in ```access_token```. However, if you just want to do some basic retrieval of media, like getting popular images (see below), then just the ```client_id``` will do. Awesome.
